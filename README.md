# CS Course Prerequisites Visualizer

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to extract data from the public spreadsheet posted on Georgia Tech's website regarding undergraduate CS courses and construct a hierarchy that illustrates the flow of courses and their prerequisites. 

This was mainly a small exercise project to reinforce Python scripting and principles of data manipulation from files.

## Skills Used

* **Python** - Language for scripts thus far
* **Regular Expressions** - Used in identifying and extracting course ID's from text based on pattern matching
* **File I/O** - Converted pdf to csv and parsed data line-by-line to dictionary structures
* **List Comprehensions** - Pythonic way of concisely manipulating and creating lists
* **Git** - first repo to practice use of Git commands

## Progress/Improvements
- [x] Basic parsing of courses and prereqs for lookup
- [ ] Handling inconsistent naming cases (i.e. capitalization, lack of subject with course number) in public spreadsheet
- [ ] Visualized, interactive tree showing all relationships at once
- [ ] Rendering partial tree based on course input
- [ ] Tree color-coding to ability to take each course based on current courses student has taken and/or their given Threads
